    <p>After moving to Seattle in 2017, we instantly fell in love with the Pacific Northwest and we can’t wait to share a bit of our home with you as we exchange vows at <a href="https://naturebridge.org/olympic" target="_blank">NatureBridge in Olympic National Park</a>. We hope you’ll join us for a weekend celebrating our love and the life we’ve built together &ndash; one day just wasn’t long enough.</p>

    <p>Here’s what you can expect:</p>
    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <p>NatureBridge is located in Port Angeles, WA, and is a 3-hour drive from the nearest airport (SEA). Parking is available on site, but we’re working to arrange carpools or other transportation options for our guests. We will let you know when more information is available.</p>
    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Our favorite thing about NatureBridge is that lodging is available for <strong>all of our guests</strong> during our weekend-long celebration. NatureBridge has 13 multi-room cabins and bathroom facilities on the grounds. Since NatureBridge is off the beaten path, there are limited affordable lodging options nearby. If you choose to stay at NatureBridge, your lodging for two nights and meals are covered for $85 per person. You will be able to reserve lodging on our website after we send out our invitations.</p>
    <h3>Friday, July 12th</h3>
    <p>Cabins are available for all guests at 3pm.</p>
    <h4>Rehearsal dinner</h4>
    <p>We are thrilled to be able to host <strong>all of our guests</strong> at our rehearsal dinner. Consider it a chance to kick-back, take in the fresh mountain air, and catch up with friends and family.</p>
    <h3>Saturday, July 13th</h3>
    <h4>Breakfast</h4>
    <p>French toast with either veggie or chicken sausage will be served for breakfast. There will also be cereal and fresh fruit options available. Coffee, tea, and milk will be available all day.</p>
    <h4>Lunch</h4>
    <p>Sack lunches will be provided at breakfast to enjoy later in the day.</p>
    <h4>Choose your own adventure</h4>
    <p>We love Washington and are so grateful to live in such a beautiful state. Two NatureBridge guides will be available from 10am &ndash; 2pm to help connect you with the surrounding old growth forest and Lake Crescent. Guided paddling adventures in Salish canoes and naturalist hikes to Marymere Falls are the most common expeditions. Bring your bathing suit and enjoy swimming in the lake or rent a canoe from down the road.</p>
    <h4>The ceremony</h4>
    <p>We will have our wedding ceremony on the lawn overlooking Lake Crescent as we try not to ugly-cry while professing our love for one another in front of the most important people in our lives.</p>
    <h4>Cocktail hour</h4>
    <p>Mingle with friends and family and enjoy some drinks and hors d’oeuvres while we take a few photos.</p>
    <h4>Dinner and dancing</h4>
    <p>We’ll relax by the lake, hang out around the fire pit, and dance the night away.</p>
    <h3>Sunday, July 14th</h3>
    <h4>Brunch</h4>
    <p>The menu will include scrambled eggs with basil and cream cheese, buttermilk biscuits served with butter and jam, turkey sausage links, veggie sausage patties, and an assortment of cereals and granola, orange and apple juices.</p>
    <h4>Checkout</h4>
    <p>Everyone will need to check out of their cabins between 9 and 10am. You are welcome to store belongings on cabin porches or in the gazebo until ready to depart, by noon.</p>
