    <h3>Weekend accommodations</h3>
    <p>Our favorite thing about <a href="https://naturebridge.org" target="_blank">NatureBridge</a> is that lodging is available for <strong>all of our guests</strong> during our weekend-long celebration. NatureBridge has 13 multi-room cabins and bathroom facilities on the grounds. Since NatureBridge is off the beaten path, there are limited affordable lodging options nearby. <strong>Lodging at NatureBridge for two nights and meals are covered for $85 per person.</strong></p>
