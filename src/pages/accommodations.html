    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Our favorite thing about NatureBridge is that lodging is available for <strong>all of our guests</strong> during our weekend-long celebration. NatureBridge has 13 multi-room cabins and bathroom facilities on the grounds. Since NatureBridge is off the beaten path, there are limited affordable lodging options nearby. If you choose to stay at NatureBridge, your lodging for two nights and meals are covered for $85 per person. You will be able to reserve lodging on our website after we send out our invitations.</p>
    <h3>Friday, July 12th</h3>
    <p>Cabins are available for all guests at 3pm, but you can arrive as early as 1pm.</p>
